# Consolidate_Benchmark_reports
Every time we get new market data, we upload it to Workday. As we use data from several survey vendors, we need to consolidate all the data in a format that the team can use to draw market insights. The datasets are so large that Excel cannot handle it (more than 1 million rows). I used python to open all the files, do the data cleaning, combine data from the 4 vendors, calculate market composites, bring in all the job profile information, and keep it in a report that the team can use to price jobs. Data size goes from 300 MB to only 10MB (97% saving in storage space). Time to run this process manually used to be a whole afternoon in Excel, so about 4 hours. It came down to one minute, so 99.5% of the time saved. We have been using this for about 2 years now.
